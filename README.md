## üìò Description

This project was born out of a personal need when popular learning platforms like Quizlet began charging for the ability to create tests from flashcard sets. This tool was built to provide a free and straightforward alternative for students, educators, and lifelong learners.

By formatting your questions and answers in a simple CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, you can use this web app to generate a clean, interactive quiz. The entire process runs in your browser, meaning your data is never uploaded to a server‚Äîensuring complete privacy.
